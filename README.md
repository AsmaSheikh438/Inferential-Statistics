# ðŸ“Š Introduction to Inferential Statistics

## ðŸ“– Overview
This repository is dedicated to **Inferential Statistics**, a key branch of statistics that allows us to make predictions, inferences, and generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics uses probability theory to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions from data.
