# üìä Introduction to Inferential Statistics

## üìñ Overview
This repository is dedicated to **Inferential Statistics**, a key branch of statistics that allows us to make predictions, inferences, and generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. Inferential statistics uses probability theory to estimate population parameters, test hypotheses, and draw conclusions from data.

## ‚ú® Key Concepts Covered
1. **Sampling and Populations**  
   - Difference between population and sample  
   - Importance of random sampling  
   - Sampling methods (simple random, stratified, cluster, etc.)  

2. **Estimation**  
   - Point estimation (e.g., sample mean, sample proportion)  
   - Interval estimation (confidence intervals)  

3. **Hypothesis Testing**  
   - Null and alternative hypotheses  
   - Type I and Type II errors  
   - p-values and significance levels  

4. **Common Statistical Tests**  
   - z-test and t-test (for means)  
   - Chi-square test (for categorical data)  
     
üìä Examples of Inferential Statistics
Confidence Interval Calculation
The 95% confidence interval for the mean is (48.5, 51.3).

Hypothesis Testing
p-value = 0.03, significance level = 0.05. Conclusion: Reject the null hypothesis.

Regression Analysis
Regression equation: y = 2.5x + 3.7 (R¬≤ = 0.85).

üåü Why Learn Inferential Statistics?
- Make data-driven decisions by generalizing sample findings to a larger population.
- Test hypotheses and validate assumptions.
- Build a foundation for advanced analytics, machine learning, and predictive modeling.
